# Knapsack-Approaches-Algorithm
Algorithm Engineering Project 2

The program can be executing via opening the 'exhaustive.py' file to run the exhaustive algorithm and the 'dynamic.py' for the dynamic programming algorithm. Doing so will take the inputs from input.txt and create an output file named after each algorithm. The output will contain the total stock amount purchased.

If you wish to change the inputs, they must follow the format:
	1. Individual problem instances must be seperated by an empty line.
	2. The first line of the problem instance is the size of the stock array, then the stock array itself, and finally the amount that can be purchased.
    3. The given size of the stock array must match the actual size of the stock array.
	4. Lists must be syntactically correct in Python to be read.
